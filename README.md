# DBMS-Lab

1. This is the repository maintaining the DBMS Lab files of semester 5, BTech.  

2. The goal is to create a web application that acts as a window for a mysql database beneath.  

**Intended features:**
1. Easy addition of data through database(button clicks which will trigger commands internally)
2. Easy install of application (possibly one command like ```build```)
3. Above install script must create database and setup everything, including hosting the server

**Abstract:** 

 **Aim:** 
To have a database related to all the information regarding all the Student Clubs existing
in NITK , their student members, projects  and the activities .


**Objectives:** 

* To allow easy storage of large amount of data in a clean, simple manner.
* To be able to make changes to the existing database pertaining to the projects or addition to members in the club.
* Maintain the data in a  proper hierarchical manner in reference to the existing hierarchies in clubs.

**Details about the project:**

The ideas will be captured by creating a web application which will have an easy to use interface to 
control activities like creation of a new entity in the database, updating the existing set of details in
the database etc. 
    It will contain attributes of the person like name, age, sex etc. It will also contain other  entities 
with which the main entity interacts with, like the existence in different clubs, projects undertaken, 
position/designation in each club. Each entities will have their respective attributes like, for the club 
entity, the different SIGs(special interest groups), the list of activities done by them like talks, meets,
workshops, publications etc. The projects will have their attributes as the details of its discipline,time 
of start and end etc.

We also will have a search bar which searches keywords from the projects of the students and
retrieves their data. This can be integrated to the main website of NITK where a student can search 
for his interests and obtain guidance from the existing students of the university.


**Frameworks and tools used:**

    MySQL : For maintaining the database, the backend of the web application.
    JavaScript : To encapsulate MySQL and provide a framework.
    jQuery, HTML, CSS : To make the UI beautiful , the frontend of the web application.
