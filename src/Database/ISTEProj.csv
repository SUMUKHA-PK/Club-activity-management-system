ISTE_1,EE,2017-08,2018,Vocal Suppression in music,ISTE,Charge,"The goal of this project was to use signal processing techniques to achieve separation of vocal tracks from background music. We made use of the fact that the background music in a song generally has a repeating structure and thus can be modeled easily, compared to the vocals. ",5
ISTE_2,EC,2017-08,2018,Optical eye tracking using OpenCV,ISTE,Charge,"he goal of this project was to develop a low-cost optical eye tracking system without any specialized hardware but with enough accuracy and precision for practical purposes. We further applied the eye tracking system we developed to create a drowsiness detector, assistive technology and experimental data visualization tools in order to demonstrate its functionality and usability.",12
ISTE_3,EC,2017-08,2018,Railway  track crack detection using IR sensors,ISTE,Charge,The aim of this project was to locate cracks present in railway tracks and update the location on a website. Crack detection was done using 2 pairs of IR led-photodiode placed on either sides of rails.NodeMCU was used to connect to Adafruit's server and Adafruit IO was used to store and display the crack location in real time.,9
ISTE_4,EC,2017-08,2018,Object detection and face recognition,ISTE,Charge,Goal is to use the concept of Image Processing to 1. Detect objects 2. Individual identification in a crowd(can be used for attendance) 3. Security (alternative for fingerprint ),6
ISTE_5,ME,2017-08,2018,Design of Driveshaft,ISTE,Clutch,"This project was a collaboration ISTE and NITKRacing with the objective being to design and improve the driveshaft currently in the FSAE NR-17, which would then be used for NR-I8, with the primary objective being weight reduction. There were certain constraints imposed on the driveshaft and we have tried to optimize the design.",3
ISTE_6,CS,2017-08,2018,Comparitive study of chatbots,ISTE,Crypt,"Developed 3 different chat-bots using AIML, DialogFlow and Regression followed by a comparison of the developed bots from a developers perspective. ",5
ISTE_7,CS,2017-08,2018,Interactive model using augmented reality,ISTE,Crypt,Project a 3d model on top of a target image and be able to interact with it,7
ISTE_8,CS,2017-08,2018,Movie recommendations using facebook data,ISTE,Crypt,Suggesting movies to users based on their Facebook profile using Machine Learning Algorithms and comparing their performances.,9
ISTE_9,CS,2017-08,2018,Sign language translator,ISTE,Crypt,"Developing a Hand gesture recognition system for the American System of Sign Language, to aid the deaf and the mute people to converse naturally. The system was also interfaced as a REST service to be used as a API service from any platform of the user's choosing, this makes the project as a whole framework for the Sign Language Translation problem.",6
