IEEE_4,CS,2017-08,2018,Generative Adversarial Networks,IEEE,compsoc,"Generative Adversarial Networks was a project tasked to study and apply the Generative Adversarial Network model to the image generation problem domain. The project comprised of two recent deep generative models â€“ the Star GAN and the Triple GAN. The Star GAN tackles the unpaired image-to-image translation problem on a given label. A live demonstration. was provided where the user fed in an image of his face along with a parameter for the model to translate (hair color, in our case). This was fed in to a trained Star GAN model and the new image was returned. The Triple GAN focused on conditional image generation on labels learned during training in an unsupervised fashion. The model showed promising results on MNIST and CIFAR-10 for both image generation and unsupervised image classification tasks.",2
IEEE_5,EE,2017-08,2018,Small scale radar ,IEEE,piston,"Radar is an object-detection system that uses radio waves to determine the range, angle, or velocity of objects.Radar was used as an acronym for RAdio Detection And Ranging.The aim of the project is to build a small scale version of such a RADAR system for educational and laboratory purposes.The radar system has coffee cans for transmit and receive antennae and components from Mini circuits.The system employs a ramp generator with a trigger output for transmission and present target is achieving range and doppler radar.Simulation of the radar system was done using Advanced Design System(ADS) software.For post processing, MATLAB is used to process the received data.The following experiments are planned and the MATLAB algorithms were implemented for the same - Doppler Vs TimeRange Vs TimeSAR imaging.

IEEE_7,EE,2017-08,2018,Undersampling and reconstruction of MR images ,IEEE,piston,"Magnetic resonance imaging, one of the foremost non-invasive imaging modalities, suffers from a slow data acquisition rate.Patients must remain in the scanner for extended periods of time, which causes them considerable discomfort, and may even delay a critical diagnosis. Reduced scan times would not only address these issues but also decrease the cost, which is a critical factor in the Indian scenario.This project compares the results obtained by applying compressed sensing and sparse dictionary learning algorithms for MR rimage reconstruction.

IEEE_8,EE,2017-08,2018,Single input single output Li-fi network ,IEEE,piston,"Wireless fidelity or Wi-Fi technology has become the norm for data transmission and reception at relatively high data speeds up to 300 Mbps.However, due to ever increasing congestion of bandwidth in the radio frequency and microwave bands, there is a dire need for a new technology that can transmit data at high data rates robustly.This project aims to explore and develop a basic Light Fidelity or Li - Fi communication system operating as a Single Input, Single Output(SISO) system capable of transmitting data over distances with robustness.",3
IEEE_9,ME,2017-08,2018,Photocatalytic Degradation of Reactive dyes using PANI AgTiO2 ,IEEE,diode,"The textile dyeing industry consumes large quantities of water and produces large volumes of wastewater from different steps in the dyeing and finishing processes.Wastewater from printing and dyeing units is often rich in color, containing residues of reactive dyes and chemicals, At present, the dyes are mainly aromatic and heterocyclic compounds, with color display groups and polar groups.Therefore, understanding and developing effective printing dye industrial wastewater treatment technology is environmentally important. If a textile mill discharges the wastewater into the local environment without any treatment, it will has a serious impact on natural water bodies and land in the surrounding area.Objectives: The broad objective of this project is to study the photocatalytic efficacy of free and immobilized Ag TiO2 nanoparticles and Ag TiO2 / PANI nanocomposites for degradation of dye waste water under solar light irradiation.Specific objectives include: To synthesize and characterize Ag TiO2 nanoparticles and Ag TiO2 / PANI nanocomposites. To investigate the efficacy of Ag TiO2 nanoparticles in suspended dye water and degradation by photocatalysis under solar light radiation.To study the effect of different factors such as the weight percentage of Ag @TiO2 nanoparticles in Ag TiO2 / PANI nanocomposites, catalyst loading and initial dye concentration on photocatalyticdegradation by Ag TiO2 / PANI nanocomposites, To study the degradation under various conditions like pH, dye concentration, catalyst loading, different time durations etc. ",3
IEEE_10,ME,2017-08,2018,Extending the use of eddy current testing on non-conductive components ,IEEE,diode,"Failure analysis is the process of collecting and analyzing data to determine the cause of a failure, often with the goal of determining corrective actions or liability.Eddy - current testing(ECT) is one of the many electromagnetic testing methods used in non - destructive testing(NDT) making use of electromagnetic induction to detect and characterize surface and sub - surface flaws in conductive materials.This method is sensitive to small cracks and other defects like surface and near surface defects.For this, minimum part preparation is required.But despite so many advantages of ECT, one of the limitations of this testing method is that only conductive materials can be inspected.In this analytical project, extended use of ECT method for non - conductors is discussed and a possible route of approach is stated.An electrically conductive liquid like PVDF mixed with fillers such as FeCl3 and MnCl2 is coated on a non - conductor to test the possibility of this approach.
